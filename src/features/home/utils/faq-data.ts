    q: "What is CipherOnce used for?",
    a: "CipherOnce is used to securely share messages, files, passwords, and sensitive information. Everything is encrypted and can be set to expire or self-destruct after access."
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from password managers?",
    a: "Password managers store your own passwords long-term. CipherOnce is designed for securely sending sensitive data to other people, with one-time access and automatic deletion."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I share files securely with CipherOnce?",
    a: "Yes. You can securely share files and control whether the recipient can download them or only view them. Files can also expire automatically."
  },
  {
    q: "Can someone download or save my shared file?",
    a: "You decide. CipherOnce allows you to enable or disable downloads when sharing files, giving you full control over how your data is accessed."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after a secret or message is viewed?",
    a: "Once a secret, message, or file is viewed (or expires), it is permanently deleted. It cannot be accessed again by anyone, including CipherOnce."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I lose the shared link?",
    a: "If the link is lost before it’s opened, the data becomes permanently inaccessible. The link contains the key, and without it, the content cannot be decrypted."
  },
  {
    q: "Is CipherOnce really secure?",
    a: "Yes. All encryption happens in your browser using strong end-to-end encryption. CipherOnce never sees your data in plain text and cannot read your content."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you store or read my messages and files?",
    a: "No. CipherOnce uses zero-knowledge encryption, which means we cannot see, read, or recover your messages, files, or secrets."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an account to use CipherOnce?",
    a: "You can share one-time secrets without an account. Creating an account enables advanced features like secure messaging, file sharing controls, and activity management."
  },
  {
    q: "Is CipherOnce free to use?",
    a: "CipherOnce offers a free tier for basic secure sharing. Advanced features like file controls, messaging, and higher limits may require a paid plan."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use CipherOnce for work or business?",
    a: "Yes. Many teams and businesses use CipherOnce to share credentials, API keys, confidential files, and sensitive information safely."
  },
  {
    q: "Is CipherOnce safer than email or chat apps?",
    a: "Yes. Email and chat apps store messages long-term. CipherOnce is designed for temporary, encrypted sharing with automatic deletion and access control."
